# EMPLOYER

# This project represents a portal (Web Page) and a Rest Web Service. It developed as part of a group assignment for a Cloud Computing course at Dalhousie University. The project consisted in simulating the process an individual will go through to get a Mortgage. The project was splitted between my group members and I was in charge of collecting employment information of individual requesting to the Mortgage broker for further Processing.

# The web page was developed using HTML5, CSS3, Angular JS and Material. It takes the user input, performs error checking and process the request by sending the information. The web page will let the user know whether or not the process was successfuly executed. The authentication of the employee is made through the Firebase with Angular Fire which securely stores and encrypts the employee login information.

# I chose to store the employment information in JSon format using Firebase with Angular Fire for ease use and the sake of learning something new.

# The REST Web Service was written in Java and communicates directly with Firebase to get the employee information.

# The Entire Web page + Web Service was hosted on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk.
